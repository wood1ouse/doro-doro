# Doro Doro - Mobile First Pomodoro Timer
![](https://github.com/wood1ouse/doro-doro/blob/development/src/assets/rmLogo.png?raw=true)


## If you're not Productive, just be Productive, lmao
But actually, there's no other chance for staying sane without systematical design of your workflow.
Pomodoro approach is just a nice option for that. You'll have sprints for 20-25 min determined work and 5-7 min break.
After every 4 work sprints break will be 20-25 minutes.
Timing is up to you but these are the best practices

## Just a freaking timer? It's a new evolve stage after todos?
Uhm, yeah. I just considered that all pomodoro services are not fine enough with UI/UX and i created this for myself.
But i believe that it could be turned into something more significant, some hierarchical system of workflow management.

Feel free to colaborate <3
